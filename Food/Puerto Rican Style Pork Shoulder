    2a. Peel skin and use knife to peel it further until you have it hanging off one side. 
         (DONT SEPARATE IT) You should be able to flap back and forth without peeling 
         off.
    2b. Using sharp knife, stab the meat as far as you can without penetrating to the 
         opposite side. You want to make holes that we will later fill with marinade.
    2c. Cut holes in all sides, make sure to twist when you stab using the Ed Bundy method.
3. Using a teaspoon, fill all holes with marinade, do this will all holes and all sides
4. Use Butcher's String to tie the meat.
    4a. Tie the string tight enough so the skin is held in place, but not so tight that 
         marinade is squeezed out of holes

3. Take out Pork Shoulder and cut the string
